# Foundational Data Products – Portfolio & AI PM Projects

![Foundational Data Products Blueprint logo](blueprint-social-badge-navy.jpg)

## About

This repo showcases how to design and ship trusted, interoperable, and AI‑ready data products in large, regulated enterprises. It brings together strategy simulations, AI‑assisted workflows, and product artifacts that reflect 15+ years of work on data platforms, governance frameworks, and AI readiness across financial and insurance organizations.

The focus is practical: moving from “talking about data products and AI” to concrete decisions, workflows, and evaluation patterns a product leader can use inside a real organization.

## Projects

- **Enterprise Data Products Strategy Simulation**  
  An interactive, quarter‑by‑quarter simulation where you play the product leader for an enterprise data platform, balancing trust, adoption, governance, speed, budget, and stakeholder sentiment. Each scenario encodes real trade‑offs from foundational data product work (quick wins vs governance, quality, semantics, AI readiness, adoption, ROI storytelling).

- **Data Product Inventory Assistant (AI Workflow)**  
  A small AI‑assisted workflow that operates on synthetic “enterprise” metadata to suggest candidate data products, producer/consumer mappings, and priority tags for foundational data product potential. It is designed to show how an AI PM might frame inventory, define evaluation metrics, and iterate on prompts/flows for quality and safety.

More projects may be added over time as the book and companion materials evolve.

## PM artifacts

The `/pm-artifacts` folder contains product‑management documents that accompany these projects, such as:

- Product briefs for the strategy simulation and inventory assistant.  
- Evaluation and experiment plans (how “good” is defined and measured).  
- Risk and assistant cards describing intended use, limitations, and guardrails.  
- Checklists and scoring dimensions inspired by foundational data products work (e.g., alignment, reuse, governance, trust, reliability, scalability), adapted for synthetic examples.

These artifacts are meant to illustrate how to turn abstract governance and AI‑readiness goals into concrete decisions, metrics, and operating models.

## Intended audience

This portfolio is especially relevant for:

- Data and product leaders, platform owners, and PMs working on internal data platforms and analytics/AI foundations.  
- Governance, risk, and compliance leaders who care about traceability, certification, and trust but want product‑centric ways to implement them.  
- AI and data teams in regulated industries (finance, insurance, healthcare, public sector) who need shared language and workflows with product management.

## How to navigate

- `/projects/strategy-simulation` – React app and docs for the Enterprise Data Products Strategy Simulation.  
- `/projects/inventory-assistant` – Synthetic data, prompts/notebook, and docs for the Data Product Inventory Assistant.  
- `/pm-artifacts` – Product briefs, evaluation plans, risk/assistant cards, and checklists that tie the projects together.

Each project folder includes its own `README.md` with details on context, setup (where applicable), and how to interpret the outputs from a product‑management perspective.

## Data and confidentiality

All examples, datasets, and scenarios in this repository are entirely synthetic and loosely inspired by common patterns in large enterprises. No real company or client data is used, and no publisher‑owned manuscript content is reproduced.
