## 1. Overview

The **Enterprise Data Products Simulator** is an interactive leadership experience that teaches users how to build and scale foundational data products inside a complex enterprise environment.

Across **six simulated quarters**, players make strategic decisions that impact:

- **Trust**
- **Adoption**
- **Governance**
- **Speed**
- **Stakeholder Sentiment**
- **Budget**

The simulator translates the frameworks of the **Foundational Data Products Blueprint** into a hands-on game where leaders practice real-world tradeoffs—without real-world consequences.

## 2. Target Audience

- Enterprise product leaders  
- Data & AI executives (CDO, CAO, CDAO)  
- Data governance teams  
- AI/ML platform teams  
- Business stakeholders learning data literacy  
- Readers of the DP Blueprint  
- Corporate L&D programs  

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Most enterprises struggle to scale data products and AI due to:

- Conflicting stakeholder demands  
- Quick-win pressure vs. governance needs  
- Poor source data quality  
- Semantic fragmentation across domains  
- Platforms not designed for AI workloads  
- Plateauing adoption and change resistance  
- Difficulty proving ROI to the CFO  

This simulator provides a **safe, experiential environment** to learn these dynamics.

## 4. Product Goals

1. Teach leaders to make balanced data product decisions through simulation.  
2. Reinforce Blueprint frameworks: SDQ, certification tiers, semantic layer, extensibility, adoption, ROI.  
3. Expose interdependencies among trust, governance, speed, and value.  
4. Deliver an engaging, memorable learning experience.  
5. Serve as a companion tool for workshops, the book, and the Blueprint App.

## 5. Core Gameplay Loop

Each quarter, the player:

1. Encounters a **realistic enterprise challenge**.  
2. Chooses one of **three strategic options**, each with tradeoffs.  
3. Impacts KPIs in positive or negative ways.  
4. Advances to the next quarter, accumulating compounding effects.  
5. Completes all six quarters and receives a final rating.

### **Q3 — Semantic Chaos Across Domains**  
Mandated standards vs. semantic layer vs. mapping workarounds.

### **Q4 — AI/ML Team Demands Platform Extensibility**  
Stabilize first vs. redesign for extensibility vs. co-create an AI-ready pilot.

Champions program vs. forced migration vs. storytelling + exec sponsorship.

### **Q6 — CFO Budget Cuts: “Prove ROI”**  
Efficiency metrics vs. compliance value vs. revenue-impacting use cases.
