# PM Artifacts

This folder contains **product management artifacts developed as part of a learning and capability-building effort** focused on enterprise AI readiness.

The artifacts here are used to:
- explore how AI-enabled capabilities should be governed and operated
- surface gaps in lifecycle design, observability, and decision ownership
- test assumptions about trust, automation, and reuse in enterprise environments

They accompany the exploratory projects in this repository and are intentionally **evolving rather than finalized**.

### Contents include:
- Product briefs for simulations and exploratory tools
- AI lifecycle definitions (from inventory and readiness through retirement)
- AI model requirement documents defining behavioral, cost, and governance constraints
- Supporting notes used to reason about risk, observability, and decision boundaries

## Status

This repository represents an ongoing learning and capability-building effort focused on enterprise AI readiness and product management.

Artifacts, simulations, and documents are exploratory and evolving. They are not production systems, finalized methodologies, or commercial offerings.

These artifacts are PM-owned and focus on **enterprise system behavior** and product accountability rather than model implementation.
