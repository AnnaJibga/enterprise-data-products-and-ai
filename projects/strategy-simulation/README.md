# Enterprise Data Products Strategy Simulator

## Overview

This project is a React-based strategy simulator where you act as the product leader for an enterprise data platform. Each quarter you choose between options that trade off trust, adoption, governance, speed, budget, and stakeholder sentiment.

## Files

- `data_product_game.tsx` – core React component that implements the simulator UI, scenarios, and scoring logic.

## Running the simulator (local)

1. Create a React app (e.g., using Vite or Create React App) or open your existing one.
2. Place `data_product_game.tsx` inside your `src/` folder (or import it into your main app component).
3. Ensure required dependencies are installed (e.g., `react`, `react-dom`, `lucide-react`).
4. Run the app with your usual command, for example:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev` or `npm start`

## What this demonstrates

- How enterprise data product decisions impact trust, adoption, governance, and speed over time.
- How a product leader balances executive pressure, data quality, semantics, AI readiness, change management, and ROI.
